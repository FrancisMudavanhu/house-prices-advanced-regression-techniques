## Project Description

### Predicting Sale Price of Houses

The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the sale prices of homes based on a multitude of explanatory variables describing different aspects of residential homes. 

### Why is this important? 

Predicting house prices is useful to identify fruitful investments, or to determine whether the price advertised for a house is over or underestimated, before making a buying judgment.

### What is the objective of the machine learning model?

We aim to minimise the difference between the real price, and the estimated price by our model. We will evaluate model performance using the mean squared error (mse) and the root squared of the mean squared error (rmse).
